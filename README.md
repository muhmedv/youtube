# YouTube Simulation (Initial Design)

## Description
This project is a basic simulation of the YouTube platform, designed primarily for large screens. Currently, the design is not responsive, meaning it may not display well on smaller screens. However, future updates will focus on making it fully responsive to improve the user experience across various devices. This version serves as an initial design layout for large screens.
